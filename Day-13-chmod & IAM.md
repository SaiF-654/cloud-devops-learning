### ðŸ”¹ Linux Practice with `chmod`
We experimented with different permission sets:

```bash
# Create a file
touch backup.sh

# Add content
echo "Currently, I am learning IAM user creation" > backup.sh

# View file permissions
ls -l

# Change permissions
chmod 755 backup.sh
chmod 777 backup.sh
chmod 644 backup.sh
chmod +x backup.sh
