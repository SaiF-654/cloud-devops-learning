Task 5: Configure UFW Firewall

A firewall is like a security guard for your computer or server. It decides what is allowed in and what is blocked based on rules.

On a web server, we allow:
‚úÖ Port 22 (SSH) for admins to manage the server
‚úÖ Port 80 (HTTP) for people to view the website
‚ùå Block all other ports to protect from hackers

[Commands to Execute]


sudo apt install ufw             # Install if not present
sudo ufw enable                  # Enable firewall
sudo ufw allow ssh               # Allow SSH port (22)
sudo ufw allow http              # Allow HTTP port (80)

          # View rules
sudo ufw status verbose

Expected Output:
Status: active
To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
22                         ALLOW       Anywhere
80                         ALLOW       Anywhere

Verify the firewall
sudo netstat -tuln | grep :80





You're now better prepared to handle real production environments. Great job!
